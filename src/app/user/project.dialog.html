  William Shakespeare's name is synonymous with many of the famous lines he wrote in his plays and prose. Yet his
  poems are not nearly as recognizable to many as the characters and famous monologues from his many plays.
  In Shakespeare's era (1564-1616), it was not profitable but very fashionable to write poetry. It also provided
  credibility to his talent as a writer and helped to enhance his social standing. It seems writing poetry was
  something he greatly enjoyed and did mainly for himself at times when he was not consumed with writing a play.
  Because of their more private nature, few poems, particularly long-form poems, have been published.

  The two longest works that scholars agree were written by Shakespear.
